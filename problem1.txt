Program Design, Algorithms, Pseudocode, and IPO

1. Create a basic application
Your 6 year old client needs an application that will receive an integer from 
the user banging on the keyboard, add 5 to it, double it, subtract 7 from it, 
and display the result to the screen.

A) Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
Algorithm: result = x + 5 * 2 -7
Pseudocode: 
1. Prompt user for numerical input
2. Get "x", our numerical input
3. Apply algorithm specified (x+5*2-7)
4. Ouput result

B) Create an IPO diagram showing input, output, and processing steps
Input: numberInput, value from the user
Process: apply the algorithm (result = numberInput+5*2-7)
Output: result

C) What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
Sequence

D) What variables are required?
input variable (numberInput) and output variable (result)

E) Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases
numberInput = 5
result = (5+5)*2-7 = 13

numberInput = 10
result = (10+10)*2-7 = 33
